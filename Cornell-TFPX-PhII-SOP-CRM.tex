\section{Scope}
This document describes the maintenance of the cleanroom. It affects all persons using this room for any work in the scope of the project.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Purpose}
The cleanroom is a crucial part of the equipment to not only manufacture DEEs, but also for module testing and module-DEE integration. It provides a controlled environment for safe handling of modules and storage.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Definitions}

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Responsibilities}
Every person is responsible to maintain a clean environment. While a minimum schedule for maintenance activities is outlined in this document, any person is allowed to trigger out-of-cycle maintenance if needed to maintain a clean environment.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Equipment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clean room
    \item Wipe pads, non-dusty tissues
    \item Swiffer ``Sweeper wet mop refills with Gain''
    \item Vacuum cleaner
    \item Sticky mats
\end{itemize}

% Consider adding images of key equipment if it helps

\section{Procedure}

% Mention to record certain observations if this is needed
\subsection{Daily maintenance}
Needs to be done only if room in use. First person entering room is responsible and puts this on records.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inspect the cleanroom for any unusual dirt. If spotted, report and trigger a weekly maintenance.
    \item Check sticky mats. If excessive dirt is observed, change mats. Record this action.
    \item Clean your work space before starting to work and after you are done!  \textbf{remember: The standard is to leave no trace of your activityâ€”or ideally, leave the workspace cleaner than you found it.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Weekly maintenance}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inspect all tables and equipment surfaces (gantry, tables, coldbox, etc.). If dirt is visible, clean it using Isopropil-Alcohol (IPA) pads/wipes
    \item Clean floor using vacuum cleaner, followed by wet cleaning using Swiffer. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Follow the pattern as indicated in the figure \ref{moppath}, repeat the pattern every 30 sq/ft. Avoid circular motions
            \item Overlap paths to make sure no surface area is missed
            \item Mop in one direction
            \item Work backwards pulling the mop towards you
        \end{itemize}
